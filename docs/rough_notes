SSO(def): SSO is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login 
          credentials

Authentication:The process of verifying a claim that a system entity or
               system resource has a certain attribute value.
               
An authentication process consists of two basic steps:
      -  Identification step: Presenting the claimed attribute value
         (e.g., a user identifier) to the authentication subsystem.
      -  Verification step: Presenting or generating authentication
         information (e.g., a value signed with a private key) that acts
         as evidence to prove the binding between the attribute and that
         for which it is claimed (user).
